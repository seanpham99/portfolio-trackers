- Foreign ownership limits still apply (49% general, 30-49% banking, sector-specific)
- Some companies have voluntarily set lower limits
- FOL premiums exist for sought-after stocks (e.g., TCB, MWG, ACB at ~7%)

### 7.2 For Strategic Investors

**Banking Sector Opportunities:**

- 49% ownership possible in restructuring banks (MB, HDBank, VPBank)
- Strategic role in bank recapitalization and governance
- Time-limited opportunity during restructuring period

**General Sectors:**

- Many sectors open to 100% foreign ownership (insurance, most manufacturing, services)
- Conditional sectors require careful navigation of restrictions
- Consider utilizing ETF structures for FOL-constrained stocks

### 7.3 Trading Strategy Considerations

**Price Limits:**

- Daily ±7% (HSX) or ±10% (HNX) requires patience for position building
- ±20-30% on first day/post-suspension provides opportunities
- Ceiling/floor price hits halt trading

**Liquidity Management:**

- Put-through transactions for large blocks (min 20,000 shares HSX)
- Reduced fees vs. regular matching
- Must negotiate within daily price limits

**Settlement Timing:**

- T+2 allows capital efficiency
- Can trade settled securities same afternoon
- Plan for public holidays (especially Tet extended closures)
